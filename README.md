**This is an e-commerce's back-end project using Spring Boot and MySQL**

This is the back end of the e-commerce website, which features JWT authentication for secure user sessions. I'm currently working on the front end and facing some challenges. 

However, the back end has been thoroughly tested using Postman, and all requests, including those related to authentication, have worked well. 
You can find a link to some of the Postman test cases in .json format below.
